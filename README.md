In this respository I will include practical examples for estimating animal density using the vertical Random Encounter Model in our manuscript entitled "A Random Encounter Model for density estimation 
with vertically oriented camera traps". R files and their related datasets are provided. 

The codes part include parameter estimation and data merging, and vREM estimation. Related data applied in the codes can be found in the data folder. The orders of the codes can be applied as contacts locations merge > parameter estimation (speed, activity level, and profile estimation (oval or rectangle) > profile contact merge (oval or rectangle) > vREM (oval or rectangle).

Feel free to give suggestions if you are interested!

In this respository I will include practical examples for estimating animal density using the vertical Random Encounter Model in our manuscript entitled "A Random Encounter Model for density estimation 
with vertically oriented camera traps". Two R files and their related dataset are provided. 

The first one entitled "profile estimation. R" used the coordinates of the first triggered point of animals (mostly front toe, partly midpoint of the parts in the first images for large species. i.e. rhino and elephant) to estimate the profiles for different species with different camera heights and models. 

The second one entitled "vREM.R" used different parameters including moving speed (km/d), activity level, profile, group size, contact, and effort to estimate the species density with standard error using bootstrap. Examples with basic created dataset were included.

Part of the parameters including speed and activity level were not provided here. More details about the estimation methods can be found from the original published paper in Rowcliffe et al., 2014 & Rowcliffe et al., 2016 (see reference).

Feel free to give suggestions if you are interested!
